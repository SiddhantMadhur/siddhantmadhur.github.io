        <br>
        <p> On 24th June of 2021, Microsoft held a big virtual event. The expectations from this event were low just until a few weeks back but recent events made this a very suspenseful event to wait for.</p>
        <p>Now, it’s no secret what “event” I’m talking about. Everyone that knows how much <a target="_blank " class="hyperlinks " href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsO-Td0hqXo "> dedicated ram a Minecraft server requires</a> knows that I’m talking
            about the Windows 11 Leak. On 15th June, just 9 days before the official Microsoft Big Event, a group on a few Chinese websites had posted a Windows 11 .iso file on the site. This came as a big shock as employee of the company, Jerry Nixon,
            had stated during a conference the following:
        </p>
        <i>
                <p class="quote ">“Right now, we’re releasing Windows 10, and because Windows 10 is the last version of
                    Windows, we’re all still working on Windows 10.”</p>
            </i>
        <p>The quote obviously fully stating that the company had no intentions to further continue the series of operating systems and rather focus on one refined OS. Why Microsoft decided to go back on their words and add another addition to the family
            is unknown as early testers have not found anything significant in the update, other than cosmetic changes, that warranted another separate version, though it might have something to do with how it isn’t supported on 32-bit systems. Albeit
            the quote from 6 years ago has been taken a bit too seriously.</p>
        <p>The .iso file for a very early dev build for Windows 11 was reuploaded to many sites such as 4Chan and Beebom for the public to download, though Microsoft Japan filed a case against the Indian based forum site Beebom for containing the leaked
            copy. They went further ahead and asked google to take Beeboms story offline from their indexing site so that more downloads don’t take place, though some would say it was too late.</p>
        <p>Supposedly if someone did have the VM, Microsoft added a very quirky feature that prevented them from being able to replace their old Windows 10 machine with the dev kit so soon. All users that tried installing it as their host OS reported that
            the installation would not take place and would give the error, “This PC can’t run Windows 11” as shown in the following screenshot.</p>
        <p style="text-align: center; font-size: smaller; "> <img width="100% " src="errorpic.png " alt=" ">screenshot from YouTube channel, Enderman </p>
        <p>The clear and easiest fix to this dilemma was running the operating system on a virtual machine which is what the vast majority of users did.</p>
        <p>
            There were however a few black sheep like YouTube channel, <a target="_blank " class="hyperlinks " href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWb-66XSFCV5vgKEbl22R6Q "> Enderman</a>, who was able to use the admin command prompt packaged with the
            installer to bypass this limitation and install it on his computer directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving on from the leaked build let us come to the Big Event that took place on the 24th. This event had a lot of excitement and dread surrounding it as all people were waiting for was an official confirmation of the operating system and the audience
            eventually got what they wanted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 45 minutes digital event covered what Windows 11 meant for the company and for the newer generations of computers which I will not be going too in-depth into as Microsoft has a done a great job in highlighting important points in their
            <a

        </p>
        <p>
            They also announced that the final operating system was finally releasing in late of 2021 and that developer versions of this would release on consumer hardware in the direct following week.
        </p>
        <p>
            On 28th of June, the first developer version released to users’ part of the Windows Insider Program and on 29th, when I’m writing this, a day of me using the new operating system has concluded. Windows 11 shows a great promise, not the same promise 10
            had showed back when it debuted in 2015 but a promise of hope if it follows the pattern of its predecessor and continuously improving each update.
