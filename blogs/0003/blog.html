            The first developer preview of Windows 11 was announced to users as part of Microsoft’s Insider program on 28th June 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Windows Insider, users with a valid license for Windows 10 or Windows Server can access prerelease builds of the operating system that were previously reserved for developers. (Wikipedia.org)
        </p>
        <p>
            As a participant in this program, I downloaded the developer version of Windows 11 day 1 and have used it for enough time to form an opinion of the operating system.
        </p>
        <p>The operating system was radically redesigned with Windows 11. Windows 10 users will immediately notice these changes since the centered taskbar is the first thing they see when the operating system is turned on for the first time. Leaks of the
            system revealed this change, so the internet has been aware of this for a while, and opinions on this change are mixed. In its announcement, Microsoft stated that this change has been made to make Windows a better experience for touch users,
            which is a reasonable move considering that many companies are releasing flipbook laptops, like Asus’ ROG Flow X13, and Lenovo’s Yoga series. Microsoft didn’t mandate this change, so users have the option to change back to the old style, where
            it would be aligned to the left. I prefer the old style since I can add or remove items from the taskbar without changing the location of the windows button, giving my desktop a more consistent look. This is purely an objective preference
            and hence the increase in choices is always welcomed, though an option to choose how you’d like it at the start of the system would be nice to have.

            The Microsoft apps have also been overhauled, with the most notable changes being the new Settings app and the new Microsoft Store, which now features Android apps.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to this, this new operating system is designed for gamers in mind and has proven to be more reliable for gaming. It supports auto HDR and DirectStorage. The Xbox X/S already has both of these new features. AutoHDR allows users to activate
            HDR for games that do not support it and improve the colors. In DirectStorage, games can send assets directly to their graphics cards rather than sending them through the CPU, as they do now. (cnet.com)
        </p>
        <p>
            I personally think AutoHDR and DirectStorage have a lot of promise if they deliver on performance, especially with how many games users with Game Pass can access.

        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, Windows 11 will be able to run APK’s natively. The APKs can be downloaded from the new Microsoft store or I assume they can be sideloaded, just like Android. Because of the size of the mobile gaming market and the need for emulators like
            Bluestack, this is a huge underrated feature.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for where I think Windows 11 will go, I predict Microsoft may take an Apple approach and create a primitive version of Apple’s ecosystem with the way they integrated the Phone App at the end of Windows 10’s life. I think the new APK system is similar
            to how iPad or iPhone games can now be played on ARM-powered MacBooks.
        </p>
        <p>
            Also speaking of ARM, it makes me wonder whether Apple’s decision to break away from Intel and create its own processor affected Microsoft’s decision to create a new operating system. Considering how they marketed the taskbar to make it easier for touch
            screens makes me believe their focus on the next generation of ARM processors will be increased.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a result of using this system, I have learned that there is always room for improvement. It was questioned why Microsoft had to create another operating system when Windows 10 had all the features they wanted, but the new update shows how much better
            Microsoft can make it. This might sound overly positive, but I also thought the system was unnecessary when I saw the leak build-up but this dev version gave me hope.
