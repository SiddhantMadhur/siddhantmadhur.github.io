            Nvidia's 1080ti: Suffering from Success

        <p>
            On March 10, 2017, Nvidia, one of the biggest names in video graphics, introduced the newest graphics card, the GTX 1080ti. At the time, and several years afterward, anyone involved in the tech scene would have heard great things about this graphics card.
        </p>
        <p>
            The GTX 1080ti was not an inexpensive graphics card for Minecraft games; it was a graphics card built for professionals and users concerned with high performance. Nvidia decided to release the card at the MSRP of $699. This high price could be justified
            by the card’s ability to outperform its competition with 11GB of VRAM.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the article, I mentioned that companies were suffering, despite this amazing card being a breakthrough in computer graphics.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since its release, the 1080ti has been a commercial success for the company, bringing in many good reviews about it and laying the foundation for graphically impressive games. A downside to creating such a powerful graphics card is that it created a leap
            for graphical technology that cannot be superseded by the same amount for at least a decade after launch. People don’t upgrade graphics cards as often as they do their phones; they upgrade them when the game settings they want becomes unplayable
            on their old graphics cards.
        </p>
        <p>Even after numerous successors to the 1080TI lineage, no card has made such an impact that requires replacing it, as it still plays all games that its successors can. Therefore, most avid gamers on a budget simply buy used 1080TIs and don’t think
            twice about upgrading.</p>
        <p>
            It is easy to determine this by comparing the 1080ti to a 3060, a new card from 2021. The 3060 is cheaper at launch, but the silicon shortages caused by Nvidia’s negligence meant that not only was the 1080ti cheaper, but it would also perform 40% faster
            (userbenchmark.com)
        </p>
        <p>
            Lastly, the success of the 1060 and 1080ti means that a generation of gamers will never experience Ray-tracing and other RTX card features, given how few games support them and how poorly they perform.
