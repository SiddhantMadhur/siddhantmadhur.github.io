            Nintendo, a Japanese video game company, announced the new model for the Nintendo Switch, on July 6th of 2021, more than 4 years after the launch of the original switch and nearly 2 years after the latest revision, where they increased battery life.

            The announcement that took place via YouTube was out of the blue as they were hush about it during E3 and on other platforms. Nintendo tweeted every new coming feature after this announcement in a thread. The biggest difference being the new 7inch screen
            on the device and the new dock with a native ethernet port.

            This announcement came with backlash as users were expecting internal hardware changes to the system to improve game performance.

            Now, something I really wish is that the new dock is compatible with the old system since its dimensions are the same, just with smaller bezels. Since the dock is the same just with a LAN port it would be a refreshing addition to my living room with its
            white scheme.
